Notes: Carrier will say all abuse is spoof by default. Need to explain (clearly) that you can dial the number and it routes to the scammers. He likes recordings a lot, so make sure to clown on these scammers. His mailbox can only handle 8MB so use dropbox or something to send the mp3 or try to compress it a bit.
